Prompt:
based on this trip description from the NOLS Alumni website create a 1000 word essay about how I spent my spring break on this trip: Join NOLS on this outstanding winter route with hopes of seeing the famous Northern Lights! We ran this trip for the first time in 2023 and are excited to continue bringing it to NOLS Alumni as a unique expeditionary experience. While participants are often surprised at the difficulty of a full day on nordic skiis, the universal praise this trip has won has been a resounding vote of confidence!
The Kings Trail (Kungsleden) is a popular hiking route during the warmer months and is transformed to a groomed backcountry oasis for nordic skiers during the winter. Rustic backcountry huts along the trail allow us to stay in warmth and minimize the amount of gear we have to bring along. The huts are minimalist acomodations with group bunk rooms, but they are warm and provide kitchens to prepare our meals and enjoy time together when off skis.
Skiing is a large part of Nordic Culture and our ski setups will be the standard layout that is used in Sweden. The skis have metal edges for easier turning and heels that can be free or locked in depending on the terrain. In US terms, they are a true hybrid between a classic cross-country ski and an Alpine touring ski. In addition to skis we will pull sleds (2-3 people/sled) to make hauling our gear a bit easier and add another skill to your repertoire. This trip is great for all levels of skiers as your NOLS Instructors will be there to help you learn.
With a bit of luck, this trip will set you up to spend time fawning under the Northern Lights. With half of the day in total darkness and no lights from a city getting in your way, the chances of seeing this natural spectacle increase dramatically.

Title: Chasing the Northern Lights: A Winter Expedition on the Kings Trail with NOLS
The anticipation bubbled within me as I embarked on a journey that promised to be nothing short of extraordinary—a winter expedition on the Kings Trail with NOLS, with hopes of witnessing the awe-inspiring spectacle of the Northern Lights. It was a trip brimming with adventure, challenges, and the potential for unforgettable moments.
As I joined fellow NOLS alumni on this unique expeditionary experience, I was immediately struck by the beauty of the transformed landscape. The Kings Trail, known as Kungsleden in Swedish, which typically sees hikers during the warmer months, now lay before us as a groomed backcountry oasis for nordic skiers. The promise of rustic backcountry huts dotted along the trail added to the allure, offering warmth and respite amidst the wintry wilderness.
The first challenge presented itself as we strapped on our Nordic skis. Despite being an experienced skier, I couldn't help but feel a hint of trepidation at the prospect of a full day on these slender, lightweight skis. However, any apprehension melted away in the face of the universal praise this trip had garnered. With the guidance of our NOLS instructors, I embraced the challenge, eager to delve into the heart of Nordic culture.
The ski setups, standard in Sweden, were a revelation. Equipped with metal edges for easier turning and versatile bindings that could be adjusted for different terrains, they represented a true hybrid between classic cross-country skis and Alpine touring skis. Pulling sleds behind us, laden with gear shared among two or three companions, added a new dimension to our journey, further enriching our experience and honing our skills.
Each day brought its own set of challenges and triumphs as we traversed the snow-covered terrain. The rhythmic swish of skis against snow became a familiar melody, punctuated by moments of laughter and camaraderie. Our rustic accommodations, though minimalist in nature, exuded warmth and provided a welcome sanctuary after a day spent exploring the wilderness.
Yet, it was the promise of the Northern Lights that truly fueled our spirits. With half of each day enveloped in total darkness and devoid of the artificial lights of the city, our chances of witnessing this natural wonder increased exponentially. As we gathered around crackling fires in the evenings, our eyes scanned the night sky in eager anticipation, hoping to catch a glimpse of the elusive aurora dancing across the heavens.
And then, as if in response to our yearning, it happened. One clear night, as we stood outside our hut, gazing up at the star-studded sky, a faint glow began to materialize on the horizon. At first subtle, like wisps of smoke drifting in the wind, it soon intensified, painting ribbons of emerald and violet across the darkness. Time seemed to stand still as we watched in awe, captivated by nature's breathtaking display.
In that moment, amidst the stillness of the Arctic wilderness, I felt a profound sense of connection—to the land, to my fellow travelers, and to something greater than myself. It was a reminder of the untamed beauty that surrounds us, waiting to be discovered for those willing to venture beyond the beaten path.
As our journey drew to a close and we bid farewell to the Kings Trail, I carried with me not only memories of adventure and exploration but also a newfound appreciation for the resilience of the human spirit and the boundless wonders of the natural world. My spring break had been spent not in idle relaxation but in pursuit of something far more precious—moments of pure magic that would stay with me long after the snow had melted and the trails faded into memory.
